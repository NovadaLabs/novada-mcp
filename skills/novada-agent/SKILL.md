# Novada Agent Skill

You have access to 11 Novada MCP tools. This skill tells you exactly which tool to use when and how to use it effectively.

## Tool Selection — Decision Tree

```

## The 11 Tools

### `novada_search`

**When:** Find pages matching a query. You know what you're looking for, not where it lives.

**Key parameters:**
- `query` — your search string
- `engine` — `google` (default), `bing`, `duckduckgo`, `yahoo`, `yandex`
- `num` — results count, 1-20 (default 10)
- `time_range` — `day`, `week`, `month`, `year`
- `include_domains` / `exclude_domains` — up to 10 domains each
- `country` — ISO code for geo-targeting (195 countries supported)

**When NOT to use:** You already have the URL — use `novada_extract` instead.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "query": "Claude API function calling examples 2025",
  "engine": "google",
  "num": 5,
  "time_range": "year",
  "include_domains": ["anthropic.com", "github.com"]
}
```

### `novada_extract`

**When:** You have specific URLs and need their content.

**Key parameters:**
- `url` — single URL string, or array of up to 10 URLs for parallel batch
- `format` — `markdown` (default), `text`, `html`
- `query` — optional: focuses the content summary on a specific aspect

**Batch mode:** Pass `url: ["url1", "url2"]` to extract multiple pages in one call — faster than calling extract once per URL.

**When NOT to use:** You don't have URLs yet — use `novada_search` or `novada_map` first.

**Example (single):**
```json
{ "url": "https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/getting-started", "format": "markdown" }
```

**Example (batch):**
```json
{
  "url": ["https://example.com/page1", "https://example.com/page2"],
  "format": "markdown",
  "query": "pricing information"
}
```

---

### `novada_crawl`

**When:** You need content from multiple pages of a site but don't have all URLs.

**Key parameters:**
- `url` — starting URL (root)
- `max_pages` — 1-20 (default 5)
- `strategy` — `bfs` (breadth-first, broad coverage) or `dfs` (depth-first, deep paths)
- `select_paths` — regex patterns to restrict to specific paths, e.g. `["/docs/.*"]`
- `exclude_paths` — regex patterns to skip, e.g. `["/blog/.*", "/changelog/.*"]`
- `instructions` — natural language hint: `"only API reference pages"`

**When NOT to use:**
- You just want a list of URLs → use `novada_map` instead (no content extraction)
- You already have all URLs → use `novada_extract` batch

**Example:**
```json
{
  "url": "https://docs.example.com",
  "max_pages": 10,
  "strategy": "bfs",
  "select_paths": ["/api/.*"],
  "instructions": "only API endpoint reference pages, skip tutorials"
}
```

---

### `novada_map`

**When:** You need to discover URLs on a site without extracting their content. Site exploration, inventory, link collection.

**Key parameters:**
- `url` — root URL to map
- `limit` — max URLs to return, 1-100 (default 50)
- `max_depth` — link hops from root, 1-5 (default 2)
- `search` — optional keyword to filter returned URLs
- `include_subdomains` — include URLs on subdomains (default false)

**Use then chain:** `novada_map` → filter the URL list → `novada_extract` batch on selected URLs. This is more efficient than `novada_crawl` when you need selective extraction.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "url": "https://docs.example.com",
  "limit": 100,
  "max_depth": 3,
  "search": "authentication"
}
```

---

### `novada_research`

**When:** You have a question that needs multiple sources to answer well. You want synthesis, not raw search results.

**What it does:** Generates 3-10 parallel search queries, deduplicates up to 15 unique sources, returns a cited report with source list.

**Key parameters:**
- `question` — the research question (full sentence works best)
- `depth` — `auto` (default, server picks), `quick` (3 searches), `deep` (5-6), `comprehensive` (8-10)
- `focus` — optional: `"technical implementation"`, `"business impact"`, `"recent news only"`

**When NOT to use:** You need real-time data or very specific factual lookups — `novada_search` is more precise.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "question": "What are the best practices for implementing JWT refresh token rotation in 2025?",
  "depth": "deep",
  "focus": "security and implementation"
}
```

---

### `novada_proxy`

**When:** You need to route your own HTTP requests through residential, mobile, ISP, or datacenter IPs — for geo-targeting, IP rotation, or bypassing IP-based rate limits.

**Key parameters:**
- `type` — `residential` (default), `mobile`, `isp`, `datacenter`
- `country` — ISO 2-letter code (`us`, `gb`, `de`)
- `city` — city-level targeting (requires `country`)
- `session_id` — sticky session — same ID returns same IP for multi-step workflows
- `format` — `url` (default, for Node.js/Python), `env` (shell export commands), `curl` (--proxy flag)

**When NOT to use:** Web page extraction (use `novada_extract` — proxy is automatic). Web search (use `novada_search`).

**Example:**
```json
{ "type": "residential", "country": "us", "session_id": "my-session", "format": "env" }
```

---

### `novada_scrape`

**When:** You need clean, structured records from a known platform — not raw HTML but tabular data. Supports 129 platforms including Amazon, Reddit, TikTok, LinkedIn, Google Shopping, Glassdoor, GitHub, Zillow, Airbnb, and more.

**Key parameters:**
- `platform` — domain, e.g. `amazon.com`, `reddit.com`, `tiktok.com`
- `operation` — operation ID, e.g. `amazon_product_by-keywords`, `reddit_posts_by-keywords`
- `params` — operation-specific params, e.g. `{ "keyword": "iphone 16", "num": 5 }`
- `limit` — max records (1-100, default 20)
- `format` — `markdown` (default, agent-optimized), `json` (programmatic), `csv`, `html`, `xlsx`

**Discover platforms:** Read the `novada://scraper-platforms` MCP resource for the complete list with operation IDs and required params.

**When NOT to use:** General web pages not on the platform list (use `novada_extract` or `novada_crawl`). Unknown domains.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "platform": "amazon.com",
  "operation": "amazon_product_by-keywords",
  "params": { "keyword": "iphone 16", "num": 5 },
  "format": "json"
}
```

---

### `novada_verify`

**When:** You have a factual claim and need to check whether web sources support it before citing it.

**What it does:** Runs 3 parallel searches (supporting, skeptical, neutral fact-check angles) and returns a structured verdict: `supported` / `unsupported` / `contested` / `insufficient_data`. Confidence score 0–100 indicates how far from a 50/50 split.

**Key parameters:**
- `claim` — the factual statement to verify (min 10 chars)
- `context` — optional: narrows search scope, e.g. `"as of 2024"`, `"in the US"`

**When NOT to use:** Open-ended questions (use `novada_research`). Reading a specific URL (use `novada_extract`). Verdict is signal-based, not a definitive ruling.

**Example:**
```json
{ "claim": "The Eiffel Tower is 330 meters tall", "context": "as of 2024" }
```

---

### `novada_unblock`

**When:** You need the raw rendered HTML of a blocked or JS-heavy page, and `novada_extract` with `render="render"` still fails or returns incomplete content.

**Key parameters:**
- `url` — URL to unblock
- `render` — `render` (Web Unblocker, faster/cheaper) or `browser` (full Chromium CDP, handles complex SPAs)

**Requires:** `NOVADA_WEB_UNBLOCKER_KEY` or `NOVADA_BROWSER_WS`

**When NOT to use:** If you want cleaned text (use `novada_extract` with `render="render"` first — it returns clean markdown). Structured platform data (use `novada_scrape`). This tool returns raw HTML.

**Example:**
```json
{ "url": "https://example.com/protected", "render": "render" }
```

---

### `novada_browser`

**When:** You need to interact with a web page — click buttons, fill forms, scroll, take screenshots, or execute JavaScript. Up to 20 chained actions per session.

**Key parameters:**
- `actions` — ordered list of browser actions (max 20)
- `session_id` — optional: maintain state (cookies, login) across multiple calls; sessions expire after 10 min of inactivity

**Supported actions:** `navigate`, `click`, `type`, `screenshot`, `aria_snapshot`, `evaluate`, `wait`, `scroll`, `hover`, `press_key`, `select`

**Requires:** `NOVADA_BROWSER_WS`

**When NOT to use:** Simple page reading (use `novada_extract`). Structured data from a known platform (use `novada_scrape`). Raw HTML without interaction (use `novada_unblock`).

**Example:**
```json
{
  "actions": [
    { "type": "navigate", "url": "https://example.com/login" },
    { "type": "type", "selector": "#email", "text": "user@example.com" },
    { "type": "type", "selector": "#password", "text": "pass" },
    { "type": "click", "selector": "button[type=submit]" },
    { "type": "aria_snapshot" }
  ]
}
```

---

### `novada_health`

**When:** First-time setup, diagnosing why a tool is failing, or confirming which Novada API products are active on your key.

**Key parameters:** None required.

**What it returns:** Status table for Search, Extract, Scraper API, Proxy, and Browser API — with activation links for any product not yet enabled.

**When NOT to use:** This is a diagnostic tool only. Don't call it in production workflows unless you're debugging.

**Example:**
```json
{}
```

## Common Workflows

### Research + Extract
1. `novada_research` for the broad answer
2. Identify key sources from the report
3. `novada_extract` on the most relevant URLs for full content

### Competitive Analysis
1. `novada_search` for competitor pages
2. `novada_extract` batch on top results
3. Synthesize findings

### Full Site Documentation Extraction
1. `novada_map` to discover all doc URLs
2. Filter to relevant paths
3. `novada_extract` batch (up to 10 per call) on filtered list

### Fresh News
1. `novada_search` with `time_range: "week"` or `start_date`
2. `novada_extract` on top 3-5 results

## Rules

1. **Batch > sequential**: Always use `novada_extract` with a URL array instead of multiple single-URL calls.
2. **Map before crawl for selective work**: If you only need specific pages, `novada_map` + filter + `novada_extract` is more efficient than `novada_crawl`.
3. **Use `focus` in research**: A focused research question produces tighter, more relevant sub-queries.
4. **Check `novada://engines`**: Different engines have different strengths — Bing has better news freshness, DuckDuckGo has better privacy site support.
5. **`novada_research` is not a search**: It synthesizes. Don't use it when you need raw URLs or specific lookups.
