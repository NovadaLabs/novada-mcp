/**
 * Canonical tool registry — the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for Novada MCP tools.
 *
 * Every tool exposed by the server (the `TOOLS` array in src/index.ts) MUST have
 * exactly one entry here, keyed by `name`. `src/tools/discover.ts` DERIVES its
 * catalog from this list — it does NOT maintain its own copy — so the discover
 * output can never drift from the tools that are actually wired.
 *
 * Drift guards (see tests/tools/discover.test.ts):
 *   1. TOOL_REGISTRY names === TOOLS names in src/index.ts (exact set match).
 *   2. The discover catalog ⊆ TOOL_REGISTRY (no ghost tools).
 *
 * This module is intentionally side-effect-free (no server construction, no
 * top-level execution) so it can be imported by index.ts, discover.ts, the
 * hosted endpoint, and tests without booting the MCP server.
